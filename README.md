# Task_Space_Controller_for_KUKA_iiwa
Example task-space controllers for KUKA LBR iiwa14 robot, including PD controller, feedforward controller, sliding mode controller, adaptive neural-network controller and nullspace impedance controller. Both position and orientation control are implemented in this project, which can be used for setpoint motion, trajectory tracking and nullspace multi-priority control. This project is fully implemented in MATLAB scripts and the simulatios run in CoppeliaSim.

## Usage
1. Open CoppeliaSim, select the scenario you wish to simulate. For example, for task-space setpoint control, you should open the scene located in `setpoint_pd/taskSpace_setpointControl.ttt`.
2. Open the MATLAB script corresponding to your simulated scene. For example, for task-space setpoint control, you should open the script located in `setpoint_pd/taskSpace_setpointControl.m` for position control (or `setpoint_pd/taskSpace_setpointControl_6dof.m` for pose control).
3. Run the MATLAB script first and then run the scene in CoppeliaSim.
* The default simulation time is 5 seconds, which can be set in the script. After simulation terminated, the script will automatically plot curves of joint torque, configuration, velocity and cartesian path, position and orientation error. A manual reset on CoppeliaSim is needed before starting a new simulation session.
